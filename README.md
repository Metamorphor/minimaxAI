# minimaxAI
An application of the minimax algorithm which pitches 2 'unbeatable' AI agents against each other in a game of Tic Tac Toe, also known as noughts and crosses. 

The minimax algorithm makes use of recursion to allow the agents to choose the point of minimum loss within the game.

To watch these unbeatable agents battle it out, just run the .py file in the command line and press Enter. Enjoy.
